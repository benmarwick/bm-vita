%%% A template to produce a nice-looking Curriculum Vitae.
%%% Originally from Kieran Healy <kjhealy@gmail.com>
%%% Kieran's source is at http://kjhealy.github.com/kjh-vita
%%%
%%% This source code has been adapted by 
%%% Ben Marwick <benmarwick@gmail.com> and is largely
%%% determined by the instructions here:
%%% \{https://admin.artsci.washington.edu/promotion-and-tenure-documentation#curriculum}
%%%
%%% questions: where to put on campus presentation on scholarly and teaching topics?
%%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% Requirements for this docuemnt that are included
%%%  in (or otherwise easily obtained) a modern tex distribution:
%%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% xelatex (I'm using MiKTeX & Texmaker)
%%% fontspec.sty
%%% hyperrref.sty
%%% xunicode.sty
%%% color.sty
%%% url.sty
%%% fancyhdr.sty
%%% memoir.cls
%%% fontawesome.sty
%%% gitinfo.sty
%%% 
%%% 
%%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% Requirements from https://github.com/kjhealy/latex-custom-kjh

%%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% Note
%%%------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% Because this is a hand-tweaked file, be on the look out for \medksip, 
%%% \bigskip and \newpage commands here and there, which are used to balance
%%% the layout or avoid widows & orphans, etc. You should of course add or 
%%% remove these as needed.

The candidate's research contributions might be described in the broader context of the discipline as a whole, explaining how his or her research agenda fits into the discipline and then how particular scholarly or creative contributions fit into this agenda. The essay should also include the candidate's statement of future directions and how these connect to previous and current work, in order to give a sense of the trajectory of the work.

I am an archaeologist interested in human behavior, technology and ecology. My approach to these themes is motivated by models and methods from the evolutionary sciences which I seek to adapt to better understand the human past. My passion as a scholar is to apply evolutionary approaches to address questions of technological variation and ecological adaptation, cultural change and cultural transmission ranging from the deep past to recent times. Unlike many archaeologists motivated by evolutionary theory, I am fascinated by the challenges of primary data collection, and my fieldwork in mainland Southeast Asia and Australia supplies the empirical content of my research. Fundamental to these activities is my deep concern for the social relevance and disciplinary integrity for archaeology. What sets my work apart from others is this combination of evolutionary theory applied to primary data collected in Southeast Asia in collaborative arrangements that prioritize training and capacity building.

We noted the absence of a signal of the Younger Dryas (YD) in our data, a key climatic event linked to the emergence of agriculture in many parts of the world. We used this evidence to argue that agriculture in Southeast Asia most likely originated in China where there is a strong YD signal.

I began this analysis with the application of three standard behavioural ecological models but found that when testing the predictions of the models with archaeological data, the three models did not give a consistent indication of the main variables influencing stone artefact assemblage production. Taking inspiration from Sewall Wright's idea of multiple optima in evolutionary biology, I revised the standard models to incorporate multiple behavioral optima and found a consistent fit with my data.

With my early work focused on inland and upland settings, I became curious about human adaptation in tropical coastal and island environments. Specifically, I was driven to evaluate the usefulness of my model for people with marine adaptations and to use the model as a tool to understand transitions to agriculture in regions where past sea level changes â which others have argued was a driving factor in the domestication process â had a profound effect on the landscape. Two current projects directly relate to this question.

So far our data show a clear signal of subsistence behaviours focused on fresh-water resources during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene shifting to mangrove swamp resources during the later Holocene as sea levels rose.

My recent work on Sulawesi, Indonesia was motivated by the question of whether my multiple optima model can be generalized to include tropical hunter-gatherer adaptations in island settings. As as co-PI with six collaborators on a project funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC), I conducted six excavations on Sulawesi during 2012-13. Two of these yielded archaeological sequences spanning the Late Pleistocene to recent times, providing data relevant to evaluating my model. We have presented some preliminary data at conferences and the detailed analyses are currently in progress.

I teach classes at every level of the undergraduate and graduate program and the common foundation of these classes is engagement of students with the breadth of archaeology through active learning methods. My 100-level class (150-250 students per quarter) investigates representations of archaeology in popular films, culminating in the students making their own films (satisfying the university's Individual and Society requirement, and many students also satisfy their writing requirement with this class). In this large lecture class I have embraced the unique challenges of engaging students at this scale, and enjoyed positive results with using clickers, online activities, in-class group work and in-class low-stakes writing assignments. Students in my 200-level laboratory methods classes (2-10 students per quarter) work side-by-side with me on hands-on data collection from field samples (sediments and stone artefacts), often presenting their results at the UW undergraduate research symposium or at international professional conferences. At the 300-level I teach two regional survey classes (Australian Archaeology, Mainland Southeast Asian Archaeology) in a seminar style that engage students directly with primary research by having students analyse data from scholarly journal articles rather than read textbooks. My 400-level teaching exposes students to skills that are vital for success in a career in archaeological science. My main effort at this level is my geoarchaeology lab and seminar classes. As the supervisor of the UW Geoarchaeology Lab I also work closely with small numbers of students on 400-level laboratory research projects (2-5 per quarter). These classes that combine instruction in widely used lab methods with collection of original data, data analysis and visualization using modern and sustainable tools, and writing a report that demands intellectual engagement with current research problems. At the graduate level I lead a seminar class on archaeology and explanation that explores connections between scientific explanation as understood by philosophers of science and archaeological explanation. To gain insights the students collaborate in the use of a combination of close reading and 'distant reading' or quantitative analysis of large amounts of text.

I am particularly enthusiastic about encouraging graduate and senior undergraduate students to adopt principles of reproducibility that I have found to be especially beneficial in my own research. To this end I require students to record their work in open lab notebooks, to use software tools that are open source (ie. R rather than SPSS), to collect and store data in open formats (ie. plain text rather than Excel), and to use scripted workflows (ie. literate computing rather than pointing-and-clicking). While the specific tools change slightly over time, familiarizing students with the principles of reproducibility is valuable because requiring students to clearly document their research encourages them to think more clearly about what they are doing and reinforce what they are learning. Documenting the research process in a way that other scientists can inspect also fosters a strong appreciation for research accountability and integrity early in the student's career.

My teaching philosophy and methods are informed by evidence-based findings about US college pedagogy and benefit from the same kind of study of peer-reviewed literature as my archaeological work. My general approach is to stimulate critical thinking about the human past and is motivated by seven principles distilled by Chickering and Gamson in their 1987 a meta-analysis of 50 years of research on good teaching principles. These include: encouraging contact between students and faculty, developing reciprocity and cooperation among students, encouraging active learning, giving prompt feedback, emphasizing time on task, communicating high expectations, and respecting diverse talents and ways of learning. These principles are the foundation of my syllabus design, course scheduling, assignments and the in-person engagement I have with my students. At the level of planning individual lessons, I organize my class time according to the three factors identified by the National Research Council report âHow People Learnâ (2000) as critical to learning: addressing studentâs preconceptions of the discipline, helping students develop a rich conceptual framework into which to place factual knowledge, and enhancing a studentâs ability to monitor their learning. I also routinely consult peer-reviewed literature on data visualization, cognitive load theory and student information literacy to continuously improve my engagement with students in and out of the classroom. I am an intensive user of technology in my teaching, employing substantial amounts of online student engagement in my courses at all levels and using a classroom response system (clickers) in my high-enrolment ARCHY 101 class. I consult with the UW Instructional Development and Research (CIDR) prior to the start of each quarter to review my syllabus and the effectiveness of assessments.

I teach classes at every level of the undergraduate and graduate program. My ARCHY 101 âArchaeology in Filmâ is the highest enrolment archaeology class at UW, with 200 students in Spring 2010. Its high regard amongst students is indicated by the rush for add codes during the registration periods and a combined adjusted median evaluation score of 4.5 (items 1-4) for the Winter 2009 offering. This popularity is in part due to the film content of the class, but more significantly due to the successful articulation of the contemporary social relevant of archaeology to studentsâ everyday lives. In the Summer of 2010 I will teach ARCHY 270 âField Courseâ as an archaeological field school an Australian desert setting with 10 students (seven from UW, three from elsewhere in the US and Canada). This field school will immerse students at the nexus of commercial archaeology and the Australian mining industry, working with BHP, the largest mining company in the world. It is anticipated that this will provide an internally unique combination of academic and professional experience to prepare students for a career in archaeology.

In the Autumn of 2009 I taught ARCHY 369 âSpecial topics: Mainland Southeast Asian Archaeologyâ which was a new class for me and the UW, scoring an adjusted median evaluation score of 4.1 (items 1-4) for its initial offering. My main lab class is ARCHY 482, which I inherited from Prof Julie Stein. I have substantially modified this class to reflect my interests and skills as well as my view on the future of the discipline. I also consult with local Cultural Resource Management firms in Seattle to identify skills and abilities that they value in recent graduates that I can cultivate in my class. In modifying this class I have introduced a number of new analytical methods and instruments to the department, such as magnetic susceptibility and phosphorus quantification by spectrophotometry which are now widely used by undergraduate and graduate students. Studentsâ experience of this geoarchaeology class is very positive as indicated by an adjusted median evaluation score of 4.7 (items 1-4) for the Winter 2010 offering. This geoarchaeology class is also my main source of students that subsequently do independent study (ARCHY 499 or ARCHY 600) with me on more specialized projects and thus a substantial generator of undergraduate research opportunities. Each quarter I advise between two and five undergraduates working on independent study research projects. In addition to my own classes, I have presented guest lectures in other undergraduate courses such as ARCHY 470, ARCHY 205 and ARCH 105. For graduate students I teach ARCHY 570 âArchaeology and Explanationâ which is a course in archaeological theory that is especially motivated and informed by philosophy of science work on explanation. The student evaluations showed an adjusted median evaluation score of 4.2 (items 1-4) for the Spring 2009 offering. A most substantial demonstration of the impact of this course is provided by two graduates of the class who were motivated to organize a session on archaeology and explanation at the 2010 Society of American Archaeology Annual Meeting, which included a number of prominent non-UW archaeologists as presenters.
